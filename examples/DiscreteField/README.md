# Discretizer Example

This example is demoing both the `FieldDiscretizer` and `DiscreteFieldGrapher` classes from the `mivp_agent.aquaticus.field` module. Discretization for state is useful in many forms of ML.

Running the `DiscreteFieldGrapher` will slow down the program and is intended mainly for debugging. 

# Running

If your X11 forwarding is configured correctly you should see, both the MOOS-IvP simulation (pMarineViewer) and a matplotlib window appear.
